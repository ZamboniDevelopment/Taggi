# Taggi
- Takes in a EBOOT.elf file as a parameter.
- Tries to find valid Tdf tags and their types based on said parameters.
- Based on the following [article](https://github.com/zeroKilo/BFP4FToolsWV/wiki/Tag-Info-Maps)
- Produces a lot of invalid results, but there are right results mixed in
- Result can be seen in out.txt in this repo, without compiling and running it yourself
